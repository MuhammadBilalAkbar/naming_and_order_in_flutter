# Naming and Order in Flutter

## Names

### DO use terms consistently.
Use the same name for the same thing, throughout your code. If a precedent already exists outside your API that users are likely to know, follow that precedent.
<br />good:
```dart
pageCount         // A field.
updatePageCount() // Consistent with pageCount.
toSomething()     // Consistent with Iterable's toList().
asSomething()     // Consistent with List's asMap().
Point             // A familiar concept.
```
bad:
```dart
renumberPages()      // Confusingly different from pageCount.
convertToSomething() // Inconsistent with toX() precedent.
wrappedAsSomething() // Inconsistent with asX() precedent.
Cartesian            // Unfamiliar to most users.
```
The goal is to take advantage of what the user already knows. This includes their knowledge of the problem domain itself, the conventions of the core libraries, and other parts of your own API. By building on top of those, you reduce the amount of new knowledge they have to acquire before they can be productive.

### AVOID abbreviations.
Unless the abbreviation is more common than the unabbreviated term, don’t abbreviate. If you do abbreviate, capitalize it correctly.
<br />good:
```dart
pageCount
buildRectangles
IOStream
HttpRequest
```
bad:
```dart
numPages    // "Num" is an abbreviation of "number (of)".
buildRects
InputOutputStream
HypertextTransferProtocolRequest
```

### PREFER putting the most descriptive noun last.
The last word should be the most descriptive of what the thing is. You can prefix it with other words, such as adjectives, to further describe the thing.
<br />good
```dart:
pageCount             // A count (of pages).
ConversionSink        // A sink for doing conversions.
ChunkedConversionSink // A ConversionSink that's chunked.
CssFontFaceRule       // A rule for font faces in CSS.
```
bad:
```dart
numPages                  // Not a collection of pages.
CanvasRenderingContext2D  // Not a "2D".
RuleFontFaceCss           // Not a CSS.
```

### CONSIDER making the code read like a sentence.
When in doubt about naming, write some code that uses your API, and try to read it like a sentence.
<br />good:
```dart
// "If errors is empty..."
if (errors.isEmpty) ...

// "Hey, subscription, cancel!"
subscription.cancel();
```
bad:
```dart
// "Get the monsters where the monster has claws."
monsters.where((monster) => monster.hasClaws);
// Telling errors to empty itself, or asking if it is?
if (errors.empty) ...

// Toggle what? To what?
subscription.toggle();

// Filter the monsters with claws *out* or include *only* those?
monsters.filter((monster) => monster.hasClaws);
```
It’s helpful to try out your API and see how it “reads” when used in code, but you can go too far. It’s not helpful to add articles and other parts of speech to force your names to literally read like a grammatically correct sentence.
<br />bad:
```dart
if (theCollectionOfErrors.isEmpty) ...

monsters.producesANewSequenceWhereEach((monster) => monster.hasClaws);
```

### PREFER a noun phrase for a non-boolean property or variable.
The reader’s focus is on what the property is. If the user cares more about how a property is determined, then it should probably be a method with a verb phrase name.
<br />good:
```dart
list.length
context.lineWidth
quest.rampagingSwampBeast
```
bad:
```dart
list.deleteItems
```

### PREFER a non-imperative verb phrase for a boolean property or variable.
Boolean names are often used as conditions in control flow, so you want a name that reads well there. Compare:
```dart
if (window.closeable) ...  // Adjective.
if (window.canClose) ...   // Verb.
```
What separates all these verb phrases from method names is that they are not imperative. A boolean name should never sound like a command to tell the object to do something, because accessing a property doesn’t change the object. (If the property does modify the object in a meaningful way, it should be a method.)
<br />good:
```dart
isEmpty
hasElements
canClose
closesWindow
canShowPopup
hasShownPopup
```
bad:
```dart
empty         // Adjective or verb?
withElements  // Sounds like it might hold elements.
closeable     // Sounds like an interface.
// "canClose" reads better as a sentence.
closingWindow // Returns a bool or a window?
showPopup     // Sounds like it shows the popup.
```
